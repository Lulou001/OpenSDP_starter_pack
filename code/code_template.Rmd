### Using this Guide

This guide utilizes data from...**explain origin of data here** 

Once you have identified analyses that you want to try to replicate or modify, click the 
"Download" buttons to download R code and sample data. You can make changes to the 
charts using the code and sample data, or modify the code to work with your own data. If 
you are familiar with Github, you can click "Go to Repository" and clone the entire repository to your own computer. 

Go to the Participate page to read about more ways to engage with the OpenSDP community or reach out for assistance in adapting this code for your specific context.

### About the Data

The data used in this guide...**explain origin of data, key features of data, and any other key information**. Create a small table of data features and description, like this:

#### Loading the OpenSDP Dataset and R Packages

This guide takes advantage of several key R packages. The first chunk of code below loads the R packages (make sure to install first!), and the second chunk loads the dataset and provides us with variable labels.**Feel free to add R packages to this, so long as they are common and trustworthy**

```{r packages, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # main suite of R packages to ease data analysis
library(magrittr) # allows for some easier pipelines of data #
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(FSA)
library(ggplot2) # to plot
library(scales) # to format
library(grid)
library(gridExtra) # to plot
# Read in some R functions that are convenience wrappers
source("../R/functions.R")
#pkgTest("devtools")
#pkgTest("OpenSDPsynthR")
```

```{r loaddataset, eacho=FALSE}
# // Step 1: Read in csv file of our dataset, naming it "texas.data"
df <- read.csv("../data/start_data.csv")  


```


```{r, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Set the cache to true when using knitr to speed up future analyses
#simouts <- simpop(nstu = 40000, seed = 8763434, 
#                  control = sim_control(nschls = 12L, minyear=1996,
#                                        n_postsec = 50L,
#                                        n_cohorts = 3,
#                                        maxyear=2017)) 
#cgdata <- sdp_cleaner(simouts)
```


### About the Analyses

**Describe purpose and methods of analyses here**

### Sample Restrictions

One of the most important decisions in running each analysis is defining the sample. 

```{r setSampleRestrictions}
# Read in global variables for sample restriction
# Agency name
#agency_name <- "Agency"

```

## Analyses

### Exploratory Analysis

**The following is an example of what the structure of an analysis component may look like**

**Purpose:** Descriptive statistics give your agency a quick snapshot of current achievement gaps among students, identifying areas for further investigation and analysis.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `grade_level` 
- `school_code` 
- `male`        
- `race_ethnicity` 
- `eco_dis`      
- `title_1`     
- `migrant`     
- `lep`
- `iep`
- `rdg_ss`
- `math_ss`
- `wrtg_ss`
- `composition`

**Ask Yourself**

- How do different study subpopulations in your organization perform on standardized tests? How do they compare?
- Why do these differences occur?
- What differences do you want to explore further?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the summary statistics for exam performance, for all 5th and 8th grade exam takers. Note: Once you set which tests and which grade levels you would like to analyze here, the code (as written) will analyze those grade levels and tests for the rest of the guide.

```{r Averages, echo=TRUE}
# // Step 1: Set which tested grade levels to analyze (5th and 8th here)
grades <- c("5","8")

# // Step 2: Set which tested subjects to analyze (math and reading here)
subjects <- c("rdg_ss","math_ss")

# // Step 3: Calculate summary stats for each grade level
# Loop over grade level
for(grade in grades){
  
  data = df[df$grade_level == grade,] #Isolates grade level
  print(paste("grade level: ",grade))
  a <- summary(data[,subjects]) #Summary stats table for grade
  print(a) #Print summary table
  
} #End loop over grade level

```
