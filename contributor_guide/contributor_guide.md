## Guide for OpenSDP R Contributors

### Getting Started
The best way to get started contributing to OpenSDP is to explore model analyses on the OpenSDP website. We recommend checking out the "College Persistence" analyis in the R programming language here: https://opensdp.github.io/analysis/.

The "College Persistence" analyis section will look like this:

<br />

Click "View Guide." The guide (displayed below) is the final product: an organized HTML page that explains the purpose behind the analysis, contains example code with comments, and displays final visual and summary outputs of the data. The intention is to make the analysis clear and accessible.

<br />

Go back to the "College Persistence" section of the main analyses page and click on "Download Code." The page that opens (displayed below) is the plain text version of the R Markdown code that generated the analysis guide. Data managers who use code from OpenSDP can easily copy and paste from these pages to get the code they need, without having to explore repositories on the back end.

<br />

One last time, go back to the "College Persistence" section of the main analyses page. Click on "Go to Repository." The page that opens (displayed below) is GitHub "back end" to the analyis guide. The repository houses the data, functions, code, and all other materials needed to produce the guide. GitHub is a platform that allows for sharing and collaborating with opens source code. If you want to contribute to OpenSDP, you will have to get comfortable uploading the materials to GitHub.

### Using GitHub to Contribute to OpenSDP
GitHub is a platform that allows OpenSDP contributors to share their code, collaborate with peers, and produce useful output for others to use. Here, we take you through the steps of initializing your work with OpenSDP's GitHub guidelines so that you can contribute to OpenSDP openly and effectively.

#### Step 1 (if applicable): Create GitHub account
If you are new to GitHub, you can create an account here: https://github.com/join.

#### Step 2: Create, name, and initialize a new GitHub repository
Repositories in GitHub are (essentially) online folders of your work that allow others to see and use your code, files, and analyses. Once you have created your account (or if you already had an account), go to the home page of your GitHub profile. Click on "New repository."

<br />

This will open a page that allows you to name your repository and control its privacy settings. 
**NOTE: Not sure which naming, read.me, and sharing conventions we want**
Do NOT check the box "Initialize this repository with a README." The repository will eventually have a README file, but that will come later in the process.

Next, you will import the basic OpenSDP files that are present in all OpenSDP R projects and analyses. These files will allow you to authentically mimic the OpenSDP methods, functions, outputs, and styles in your analyses.

Click the "import code" option at the bottom of the page. Copy and paste this URL (https://github.com/youngsaver/OpenSDP_starter_pack) into the space provided for URLs. Then click "Begin import." 

GitHub will email you a link to see the finished product once the import has finished. Your new repository, after importing, should look like this:
